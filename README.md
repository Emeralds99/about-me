"About me" 

Hi, my name is Peter Harrington. I graduated with a bachelors in Microbiology from Hampshire College a couple of yoears ago but haven't found a lot of passion or use for that degree and have been working in customer facing retail jobs since my graduation. I'm a big film nerd and currently work as a manager at a local movie theater but I've made the decision to try and move my career into tech after seeing friends and family have so much success in the field.
